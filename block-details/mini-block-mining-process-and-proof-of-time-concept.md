# â–ª Mini-block - Mining Process and Proof of Time Concept

{% hint style="info" %}
The OC Project's innovative mining process revolves around mini-blocks, which are integral to the token distribution and the unique proof of time concept. The mini-block mining process offers users the opportunity to mine OC tokens, while also ensuring that the platform's rewards are fairly and transparently distributed. The following details the mini-block mining process and the proof of time concept:

<details>

<summary>Mini-Block Structure</summary>

Each main block in the OC Project has 10 million mini-blocks attached to it. These mini-blocks contain the remaining 50% of OC tokens allocated to their associated main block, and they serve as the foundation for the mining process using the proof of time concept.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Proof of Time Concept</summary>

The proof of time concept is designed to promote fairness and equal opportunity in the OC Project's mining process. It requires miners to spend a sufficient amount of time and perform hashing work before claiming the OC tokens contained in a mini-block. This ensures that all miners have an equal chance to access the platform's resources, regardless of their computational power or financial resources.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Mining Process</summary>

Miners will begin by selecting a mini-block attached to a main block. To mine the OC tokens within the mini-block, they must dedicate an appropriate amount of time to the task and complete the necessary hashing work. Once the required time has elapsed, and the miner has successfully performed the hashing work, they can claim the OC tokens contained in the mini-block.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Accelerators</summary>

To enhance the mining experience and offer additional opportunities for miners, the OC Project features accelerators. These accelerators can be purchased using OC tokens and grant users various benefits, such as continuous mining without clicking "Accept," reduced mining time, or the ability to mine multiple blocks simultaneously. Accelerators can be combined to create custom mining experiences tailored to individual preferences and needs.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Staking and Main Block Ownership</summary>

After mining OC tokens from a mini-block, miners can use these tokens to stake in other mini-blocks within different main blocks. By staking their OC tokens, miners can acquire a percentage of ownership in the associated main block (collectible), thus gaining access to valuable world-class assets and further diversifying their holdings.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Mining Completion</summary>

Once all 10 million mini-blocks associated with a main block have been mined, the main block will be chained into the blockchain with earlier main blocks. This ensures an orderly and consistent progression within the OC Project's ecosystem and creates a stable environment for mining and asset ownership.hint

{% hint style="info" %}
The mini-block mining process and proof of time concept are fundamental to the OC Project's unique value proposition, offering users an equal and fair opportunity to mine OC tokens and access world-class collectibles. By participating in the mining process and staking their tokens, miners can engage with the platform's diverse range of assets and preserve their wealth through a novel and equitable approach to cryptocurrency mining.
