# â¬› Main block - Features and Allocation of OC Tokens

{% hint style="info" %}
Main blocks play a crucial role in the OC Project's ecosystem, as they represent world-class collectibles and form the foundation of the platform's unique value proposition. Understanding the features of main blocks and the allocation of OC tokens to each block is essential to grasp the project's structure and token distribution strategy. The following outlines the main features of the main blocks and the process of allocating OC tokens:
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Main Block Representation</summary>

Each main block represents a world-class collectible, which has been donated by a benevolent collectible owner to participate in the OC Project. These collectibles are carefully curated and ranked by an initial group of miners, ensuring that they represent the highest value and broadest range of assets.

</details>

<details>

<summary>OC Token Allocation</summary>

The 21 quadrillion OC tokens will be allocated to each main block based on the categorization and weighted scores determined during the ranking process. This allocation ensures that the OC tokens are distributed fairly and proportionately to each main block according to their relative value within the platform.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Chaining and Release Schedule</summary>

The main blocks will be chained and released on the OC Project platform in a predetermined order based on their ranking. Every week, a new main block (collectible) will be selected for mining, following an alternating pattern between higher and lower-ranked collectibles (starting from 500th, 499th, 501st, 498th, 502nd, 497th, 503rd, etc.). This dynamic release schedule creates an engaging and diverse mining experience for the OC Project's participants.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Token Vesting for Collectible Owners</summary>

Out of the total OC tokens allocated to each main block, 50% will be vested to the collectible owners over a period of 24 months. This vesting mechanism ensures that the collectible owners are fairly rewarded for their contribution to the OC Project, and it incentivizes their continued involvement in the platform's development.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Token Distribution for Mini-Blocks</summary>

The remaining 50% of OC tokens allocated to each main block will be distributed among its associated 10 million mini-blocks. These mini-blocks are the units that miners will be mining through the proof of time concept, thus ensuring that a broad range of users have the opportunity to participate in the OC token mining process.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Voting and Decision-making</summary>

A voting smart contract will manage the decisions of the OC stakers who become the owners of a main block. This smart contract will facilitate decision-making related to the sale of the collectible, administration of the associated Telegram group, or authorship within the collectible community. This feature empowers the main block owners to make collective decisions and influence the future of their valuable assets.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Main Block Completion</summary>

Each main block will only be chained into the blockchain with earlier main blocks upon the completion of mining its 10 million mini-blocks. This ensures that the main blocks are integrated into the blockchain in an orderly and consistent manner, creating a stable and transparent ecosystem for OC token mining and collectible ownership.
