<details>

<summary>Simultaneous Mining Capability</summary>

Nano-Bot allows users to mine more than one nano-block at a single mining. This means that miners can significantly increase their mining efficiency and accumulate more OC tokens within a same period, making the overall mining experience more rewarding and efficient.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Scalability and Customization</summary>

The simultaneous mining feature of Nano-Bot is scalable, enabling users to mine multiple nano-blocks according to their preferences and investment capacity. By purchasing additional Nano-Bot, miners can further increase the number of nano-blocks they mine simultaneously, tailoring their mining experience to suit their specific requirements.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Improved User Experience</summary>

Ability to mine multiple nano-blocks simultaneously using Nano-Bot not only increases mining efficiency but also enhances the overall user experience. This feature encourages user engagement and fosters a sense of accomplishment, as miners can observe tangible results from their efforts in a shorter time frame.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Ease of Purchase and Access</summary>

Nano-Bot can be purchased using OC tokens, ensuring that users within the OC Project ecosystem have easy access to this feature. By acquiring OC tokens through mining or trading, miners can seamlessly invest in Nano-Bot to enhance their mining capabilities.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Compatibility with Other Accelerators</summary>

Nano-Bot can be used in combination with other accelerators available in Phase 2.0, such as RTC (continuous mining without "Start Mining" button) and Nano-Bot (simultaneous mining of other nano-blocks). This compatibility ensures that users can create a personalized mining experience that caters to their unique needs, maximizing their efficiency and productivity.
