# üêù Round The Clock: Continuous mining without "Accept" button

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;<mark style="color:orange;">**Round the Clock**</mark> ("<mark style="color:orange;">**RTC**</mark>") is one such feature that will provide miners with the ability to mine continuously without needing to click the "Accept" button for each completed mini-block.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Scalability</summary>

The implementation of RTC is designed to be scalable, meaning that users can purchase multiple instances of RTC to enable improved continuous mining for multiple mini-blocks. For example, purchasing two RTC instances would allow for continuous mining of two mini-blocks, purchasing three RTC instances would allow for continuous mining of three mini-blocksfurther increasing mining efficiency.

<details>

<summary>Increased Mining Efficiency</summary>

By allowing continuous mining without interruption, RTC can help miners increase their mining efficiency and potentially earn more OC tokens in a shorter period. This is especially advantageous for dedicated miners looking to optimize their mining operations.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Improved User Experience</summary>

RTC is designed to streamline the mining process for users by automating the acceptance of newly mined mini-blocks. This eliminates the need to manually click the "Accept" button for every single mini-block mining, making the mining experience more seamless and enjoyable for users.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Ease of Purchase</summary>

RTC can be purchased with OC tokens, making it easily accessible for users within the OC Project ecosystem. Users can simply acquire OC tokens through mining, staking, or trading and use them to purchase RTC to enhance their mining experience.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Flexible Usage</summary>

RTC can be used in combination with other accelerators available in Phase 2.0, such as Timer Saver (reduced mining time) and Block Enhancer (simultaneous mining of multiple mini-blocks). This flexibility allows miners to create customized mining experiences that cater to their specific needs and preferences.

{% hint style="info" %}
RTC provides a valuable enhancement to the mining experience within the OC Project by allowing for continuous mining without the need to click the "Accept" button. This feature improves the user experience, increases mining efficiency, and offers scalability and flexibility for users seeking to optimize their mining operations in the OC Project ecosystem.
