<details>

<summary>Smart Contract Implementation</summary>

Utilizing smart contracts on the TON Blockchain, the OC Project will establish a system that automatically distributes any proceeds or income generated by the Main-Block assets. These smart contracts will serve as the backbone for the automatic distribution process, ensuring its efficiency, transparency, and reliability.

<details>

<summary>Equitable Sharing of Benefits</summary>

The automatic distribution system will be designed to share the proceeds or income generated by the Main-Block assets among all eligible participants, such as OC stakers, miners, and other stakeholders. This equitable sharing mechanism fosters a sense of fairness and inclusivity, promoting increased engagement within the OC Project's community.

<details>

<summary>Distribution Based on Ownership Stake</summary>

The proceeds or income will be distributed proportionally, based on each participant's ownership stake in the Main-Block. This ensures that users who have contributed more to the platform by mining, staking, or purchasing OC tokens receive a fair share of the benefits generated by the Main-Block assets.

<details>

<summary>Transparency and Trust</summary>

The automatic distribution of proceeds/income will be recorded on the TON Blockchain, providing an immutable and transparent record of all transactions. This level of transparency bolsters trust among the OC Project's community members, ensuring that all participants can independently verify the accuracy and fairness of the distribution process.

<details>

<summary>Real-time Distribution</summary>

Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, the automatic distribution system will enable real-time allocation of proceeds or income to eligible participants. This means that as soon as a Main-Block asset generates income or value, the proceeds will be instantly and securely distributed to stakeholders without delays or intermediaries.

<details>

<summary>Reduced Administrative Burden</summary>

By automating the distribution process, the OC Project eliminates the need for manual intervention or third-party intermediaries, reducing the administrative burden and associated costs. This streamlined approach ensures that the platform remains cost-effective and efficient, directing more resources towards its users and the overall project development.
