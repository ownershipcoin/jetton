# âš– Strategies for Promoting Fairness, Equality and Access to Resources

{% hint style="info" %}
The OC Project's core values emphasize fairness, equality, and access to resources. By building a cryptocurrency ecosystem based on these principles, the project aims to empower underprivileged communities and promote financial inclusion. The following strategies will be implemented to achieve these objectives:

<details>

<summary>Proof of Time Concept</summary>

The proof of time concept, which underlies the OC mining process, is designed to level the playing field for all participants, regardless of their financial means. Since TIME is a resource that everyone has equal access to, this mechanism ensures that mining opportunities are distributed fairly, without favoring those with more capital or technological resources.

<details>

<summary>Staged Roadshows</summary>

The OC Project will organize a series of roadshows in countries with lower income per capita, working closely with local NGOs and organizations to target and assist underprivileged communities. These roadshows will help raise awareness about the project, educate potential participants about the concept of proof of time, and offer opportunities for people to join the OC ecosystem as miners, regardless of their financial background.

<summary>Partnerships with NGOs and Other Organizations</summary>

Forming strategic partnerships with NGOs and other organizations focused on financial inclusion and equality will help the OC Project expand its reach and impact. These partnerships will facilitate joint initiatives, programs, and campaigns aimed at promoting equal access to resources and opportunities within the OC ecosystem.

<summary>Incentivizing Main Block Ownership</summary>

By allocating a portion of OC tokens to the main blocks and enabling participants to stake these tokens for a share of ownership, the project encourages a more egalitarian distribution of valuable assets (world-class collectibles). This system allows people from diverse backgrounds to benefit from the appreciation of these collectibles and the income generated by their main blocks.

<details>

<summary>Governance and Decision-Making</summary>

The OC ecosystem will incorporate smart contracts for voting and decision-making, allowing token holders to have a say in the management and direction of the project. This democratic approach fosters a sense of community and ensures that the ecosystem's growth and development reflect the needs and desires of its participants, rather than being dictated by a select few.

<details>

<summary>Accessible Accelerators</summary>

By offering accelerators that improve the mining experience, such as continuous mining, reduced mining time, and simultaneous mining of multiple blocks, the OC Project makes it easier for participants to mine OC tokens more efficiently. These accelerators are designed to be accessible to all miners, regardless of their financial means, further promoting fairness and equality in the ecosystem.

By implementing these strategies, the OC Project will foster an environment that encourages fairness, equality, and access to resources. The project's emphasis on inclusivity and equal opportunity will contribute to the creation of a diverse and vibrant community, where participants from all walks of life can benefit from the OC token and its underlying ecosystem.
