# âš– Strategies for Promoting Fairness, Equality and Access to Resources

{% hint style="info" %}
The OC Project's core values emphasize fairness, equality, and access to resources. By building a cryptocurrency ecosystem based on these principles, the project aims to empower underprivileged communities and promote financial inclusion. The following strategies will be implemented to achieve these objectives:

<summary>Proof of Time Concept</summary>

The proof of time concept, which underlies the OC mining process, is designed to level the playing field for all participants, regardless of their financial means. Since TIME is a resource that everyone has equal access to, this mechanism ensures that mining opportunities are distributed fairly, without favoring those with more capital or technological resources.

<summary>Staged Roadshows</summary>

The OC Project will organize a series of roadshows in countries with lower income per capita, working closely with local NGOs and organizations to target and assist underprivileged communities. These roadshows will help raise awareness about the project, educate potential participants about the concept of proof of time, and offer opportunities for people to join the OC ecosystem as miners, regardless of their financial background.

<summary>Incentivizing Main Block Ownership</summary>

By allocating a portion of OC tokens to the main blocks and enabling participants to stake these tokens for a share of ownership, the project encourages a more egalitarian distribution of valuable assets (world-class collectibles). This system allows people from diverse backgrounds to benefit from the appreciation of these collectibles and sharing of ownership in the world class collectibles.

<summary>Governance and Decision-Making</summary>

The OC ecosystem will incorporate smart contracts for voting and decision-making, allowing token holders to have a say in the management and direction of the project. This democratic approach fosters a sense of community and ensures that the ecosystem's growth and development reflect the needs and desires of its participants, rather than being dictated by a select few.

By implementing these strategies, the OC Project will foster an environment that encourages fairness, equality, and access to resources. The project's emphasis on inclusivity and equal opportunity will contribute to the creation of a diverse and vibrant community, where participants from all walks of life can benefit from the OC token and its underlying ecosystem.
