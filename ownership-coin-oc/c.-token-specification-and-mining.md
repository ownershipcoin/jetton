# ‚õè C. Token Specification and Mining

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Ownership Coin (OC) is a Layer-2 Jetton token created on the TON blockchain as the primary utility token for the OC Project. Designed to harness the power of time as a valuable commodity, OC tokens represent a new class of digital assets backed by the inherent value of time and world-class collectibles. The following sections detail the token specifications, Mining and World Class Collectibles:

<summary>Token Specifications</summary>

1. **Token Type**: OC is a Layer-2 Jetton token built on the TON blockchain, leveraging its advanced architecture, scalability, and security features to facilitate seamless and efficient transactions within the OC Project ecosystem.
2. **Token Symbol:** OC (Ownership Coin)
3. **Total Supply**: A fixed total of 21 quadrillion OC tokens will be issued, ensuring a sufficient supply to support the diverse range of use cases and functionalities envisioned for the OC Project and no new OC tokens will ever be issued.
4. **Decimals**: OC tokens will have a fixed number of decimals, allowing for precise calculations and enabling users to transact with the desired level of accuracy.
5. **Smart Contracts**: OC tokens will be governed by a set of smart contracts that manage various aspects of the token's functionality, such as distribution, mining, staking, and voting. These smart contracts ensure the automated, transparent, and secure management of OC tokens within the ecosystem.

<summary>Mining Process</summary>

1. **Allocation to Main-Blocks:** The 21 quadrillion OC tokens will initially be allocated among 2,100 Main-Blocks, which represent 2,100 world-class collectibles curated for the OC Project. The allocation of OC tokens to each Main-Block will be based on a weighted scoring system, determined by the categorization and ranking of the collectibles.
2. **Vesting to Collectible Owners:** **50% of the allocated OC tokens** for each Main-Block will be vested to the respective collectible owners over a **24-month period**. This distribution strategy ensures a gradual release of tokens into the ecosystem, promoting long-term stability and encouraging commitment from the collectible owners.
3. **Distribution to Mini-Blocks:** The **remaining 50% of the allocated OC tokens** for each Main-Block will be distributed among the **10 million Mini-Blocks** associated with the respective Main-Block. Each Mini-Block is subdivided into **100,000 Nano-Blocks** to serve as the mining units for OC tokens, allowing miners to generate OC tokens using the Proof of Time concept.
4. **Mining Process:** Miners participating in the OC Project will be able to mine OC tokens by dedicating time and effort to the "work-unit" i.e. the 100,000 nano-block within a mini-block. Once the required time has elapsed, and the miner has successfully performed the hashing work (which is embedded in the nano-bot), they can claim the OC tokens contained in the nano-block.
