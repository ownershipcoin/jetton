# ⬛ A. Block Structure

{% hint style="info" %}
**Block Structure:** The structure of the OC Project’s blockchain is designed with a 3 fractional divisions consisting of main blocks, mini-blocks, and nano-blocks. This three-layered fractional division block structure adds a unique dimension to the mining process and offers participants various levels of interaction.

1. **Main Blocks**: The OC Project Block-Chain consists of 2,100 main blocks. Each of these main blocks represents a unique world class collectible within the OC Block-Chain. They are chained together in a predefined sequence, forming the foundational layer of the OC Block-Chain.
2. **Mini-Blocks**: Each main block is subdivided into 10,000,000 mini-blocks. These mini-blocks represent a second layer of subdivision within each main block and are the fundamental units available for mining. Each main block releases its mini-blocks for mining in an epoch time manner and staged process, providing a dynamic and engaging mining experience.
3. **Nano-Blocks**: Going a level deeper, each mini-block is further divided into 100,000 nano-blocks. These nano-blocks are the smallest subdivisions within the block structure and represent the actual 'work units' for miners. A miner engages in the mining process at the nano-block level.

The mining process in the OC Project revolves around the nano-blocks. Each nano-block requires a time commitment of 6 seconds from the miner to complete the mining process. This 'proof of time' mechanism ensures that every participant contributes an equal amount of time to mine each nano-block, adhering to the principle of fairness in the distribution of OC tokens.

This hierarchical block structure, combined with the unique proof of time concept, forms the core of the OC Project’s approach to mining, allowing for an inclusive, equitable, and engaging participation in the world of cryptocurrency.

**OC Allocation:** The allocation of Ownership Coin (OC) tokens to main blocks, mini-blocks and nano-block is a crucial aspect of the OC Project, as it dictates the distribution of the token supply among collectibles and their associated mining units. This section outlines the process of allocating OC tokens to main blocks and mini-blocks, and how this allocation strategy contributes to the project's goals and objectives.

1. **Categorization and Ranking of Collectibles:** The first step in the allocation process involves categorizing and ranking the 2,100 world-class collectibles that form the basis of the OC Project. Each collectible will be evaluated based on various criteria, such as estimated value (in USD), the number of followers, and the quality of the collectible. The initial group of 100 miners, along with a robust screening process, will categorize the collectibles and provide ratings.
2. **Weighted Scoring System:** The ratings assigned to each collectible will be used to calculate a weighted score, which in turn determines the collectible's ranking. The ranking system ensures that the allocation of OC tokens to each main block (representing a collectible) is proportionate to its perceived value and significance within the ecosystem.
3. **Allocation of OC Tokens:** Based on the weighted scores and rankings, the 21 quadrillion OC tokens will be allocated among the 2,100 main blocks. The higher-ranked collectibles will receive a larger share of the token supply, reflecting their status and importance in the OC Project.

1. **Splitting the Token Supply:** Once the allocation of OC tokens to main blocks is complete, the remaining 50% of the allocated tokens for each main block will be further distributed among its 10 million mini-blocks. These mini-blocks serve as the individual epoch time mining block for the miner within the OC Project, enabling miners to generate OC tokens using the Proof of Time concept.
2. **Equal Distribution:** Each mini-block within a main block will receive an equal share of the allocated OC tokens. This equal distribution ensures that every mini-block provides an equal opportunity for miners to generate value and participate in the OC Project.

<summary>More Information: <strong>Nano-Blocks</strong></summary>

1. The nano-blocks are the smallest units within the OC Project's block structure and signify the core operational components of the mining process. Each mini-block comprises 100,000 nano-blocks, which contains the OC to be mined and unlocked by miners.
2. The primary feature of a nano-block is its time-bound nature. To mine a nano-block, a miner must devote a set amount of time, 6 seconds. This 'proof-of-time' element embeds the value of time into the fundamental structure of the OC token system.
3. The nano-block level is where the concept of "time as a commodity" truly comes to life in the OC Project. As miners invest their time to mine these nano-blocks, they're effectively converting their time into OC tokens, hence storing their time as cryptocurrency.
4. Each successfully mined nano-block results in the release of a certain number of OC tokens to the miner, according to the preset allocation rules.
5. In essence, nano-blocks serve as the fundamental 'work units' for miners, embodying the project's core principle of fairness. This is because every participant must contribute an equal amount of time to mine each nano-block, creating a level playing field for all, regardless of their computational resources or economic status.
6. The vast number of nano-blocks - resulting from the division of mini-blocks - also ensures a high granularity of the mining process, allowing for a more distributed and inclusive participation. Furthermore, this fine granularity can enable a more gradual and stable release of OC tokens into the ecosystem.
7. In summary, nano-blocks provide the primary interface between the miner's effort and the OC token reward, embodying the project's core values of time value, fairness, and inclusivity.

**Summary:** The allocation of OC tokens to main blocks, mini-block and nano-block hierarchically plays a critical role in shaping the overall dynamics of the OC Project. By employing a weighted scoring system for the main blocks and equal distribution for mini-blocks and then nano-block, the allocation process promotes fairness and inclusivity, while also recognizing and rewarding the value of world-class collectibles within the ecosystem.
