<summary>Issuance Process</summary>

1. **Allocation to Main-Blocks:** The 21 quadrillion OC tokens will initially be allocated among 1,000 Main-Blocks, which represent 1,000 world-class collectibles curated for the OC Project. The allocation of OC tokens to each Main-Block will be based on a weighted scoring system, determined by the categorization and ranking of the collectibles.
2. **Vesting to Collectible Owners:** 50% of the allocated OC tokens for each Main-Block will be vested to the respective collectible owners over a 24-month period. This distribution strategy ensures a gradual release of tokens into the ecosystem, promoting long-term stability and encouraging commitment from the collectible owners.
3. **Distribution to Mini-Blocks:** The remaining 50% of the allocated OC tokens for each Main-Block will be distributed among the 10 million Mini-Blocks associated with the respective Main-Block. These Mini-Blocks serve as the mining units for OC tokens, allowing miners to generate OC tokens using the Proof of Time concept.
4. **Mining Process:** Miners participating in the OC Project will be able to mine OC tokens contained within the Mini-Blocks by dedicating time and effort to the network. The mining process, governed by the Proof of Time concept, ensures that all participants have an equal opportunity to generate value and contribute to the ecosystem.
