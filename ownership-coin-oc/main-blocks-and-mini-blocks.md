# ‚õè Main Blocks and Mini-Blocks

{% hint style="info" %}
**Fair Allocation:** The allocation of Ownership Coin (OC) tokens to main blocks and mini-blocks is a crucial aspect of the OC Project, as it dictates the distribution of the token supply among collectibles and their associated mining units. This section outlines the process of allocating OC tokens to main blocks and mini-blocks, and how this allocation strategy contributes to the project's goals and objectives.

<summary>Allocation to Main Blocks</summary>

1. **Categorization and Ranking of Collectibles:** The first step in the allocation process involves categorizing and ranking the 1,000 world-class collectibles that form the basis of the OC Project. Each collectible will be evaluated based on various criteria, such as estimated value (in USD), the number of followers, and the quality of the collectible. The initial group of 100 miners, along with a robust screening process, will categorize the collectibles and provide ratings.
2. **Weighted Scoring System:** The ratings assigned to each collectible will be used to calculate a weighted score, which in turn determines the collectible's ranking. The ranking system ensures that the allocation of OC tokens to each main block (representing a collectible) is proportionate to its perceived value and significance within the ecosystem.
3. **Allocation of OC Tokens:** Based on the weighted scores and rankings, the 21 quadrillion OC tokens will be allocated among the 1,000 main blocks. The higher-ranked collectibles will receive a larger share of the token supply, reflecting their status and importance in the OC Project.

<summary>Allocation to Mini-Blocks</summary>

1. **Splitting the Token Supply:** Once the allocation of OC tokens to main blocks is complete, the remaining 50% of the allocated tokens for each main block will be further distributed among its 10 million mini-blocks. These mini-blocks serve as the individual mining units within the OC Project, enabling miners to generate OC tokens using the Proof of Time concept.
2. **Equal Distribution:** Each mini-block within a main block will receive an equal share of the allocated OC tokens. This equal distribution ensures that every mini-block provides an equal opportunity for miners to generate value and participate in the OC Project.
3. **Mining Process:** Miners can mine OC tokens contained within the mini-blocks by dedicating time and effort to the network. The Proof of Time concept, which governs the mining process, ensures that all participants have an equal opportunity to mine tokens and contribute to the ecosystem.

**Summary:** The allocation of OC tokens to main blocks and mini-blocks plays a critical role in shaping the overall dynamics of the OC Project. By employing a weighted scoring system for the main blocks and equal distribution for mini-blocks, the allocation process promotes fairness and inclusivity, while also recognizing and rewarding the value of world-class collectibles within the ecosystem.
