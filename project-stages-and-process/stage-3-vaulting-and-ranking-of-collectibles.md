{% hint style="info" %}
The proper handling, storage, and categorization of the 1,000 collectibles play a crucial role in the OC Project. Ensuring the safety and security of these valuable assets and organizing them effectively is essential to maintaining the platform's unique value proposition. The following outlines the steps involved in vaulting and categorizing the collectibles:

<details>

<summary>Stage 3.1 : Submission and Documentation</summary>

As mentioned earlier, collectible owners will submit detailed information about their assets, including provenance, appraisals, and any other relevant documentation to attest to the authenticity and value of the collectibles. This information will serve as the foundation for the categorization process.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Stage 3.2 : Verification and Authentication</summary>

The project team will carefully review and verify the submitted information for each collectible. This process ensures that only legitimate and valuable collectibles are included in the platform, safeguarding its integrity and reputation.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Stage 3.3 : Categorization</summary>

With the collectible information verified and authenticated, the initial group of miners, along with input from the project team, will categorize the collectibles based on factors such as estimated value (in USD), the number of followers or fans, historical significance, cultural importance, and overall quality of the asset. This categorization will serve as the basis for the subsequent ranking process.

<summary>Stage 3.4 : Ranking and Weighted Scoring</summary>

As previously described, the initial group of miners will assign ratings to each collectible, which will be used to calculate a weighted score. This score will determine the collectible's overall ranking within the platform and influence the allocation of OC tokens to the respective main blocks.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Stage 3.5 : Secure Transit Vault (STV) Storage</summary>

To ensure the safety and security of the collectibles, they will be locked into a secure transit vault (STV) once the ranking and allocation process is completed. The STV will provide a high-security storage solution that protects the valuable assets from theft, damage, or unauthorized access.

<details>

<summary>Stage 3.6 : Digital Representation and Integration</summary>

Each collectible will be assigned a unique identifier and digitally represented on the OC Project platform. This digital representation will include detailed information about the collectible's provenance, historical significance, and cultural importance, along with high-resolution images that showcase its unique qualities.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Stage 3.7 : Linking to Main and Mini-Blocks</summary>

With the digital representation complete, each collectible will be integrated into the platform as a main block, linked to 10 million mini-blocks. These mini-blocks will serve as the mining units for generating OC tokens, allowing users to mine and earn tokens based on their participation in the proof of time concept.

By carefully vaulting and categorizing the collectibles, the OC Project ensures that its platform maintains a high standard of security and organization. This approach protects the valuable assets at the core of the project, while also creating a robust and engaging platform for users to participate in the mining and staking process.
