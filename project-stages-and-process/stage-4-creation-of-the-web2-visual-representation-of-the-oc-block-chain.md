# â›“ Stage 4 : Creation of the Web2 Visual Representation of The OC Block-Chain

{% hint style="info" %}
A user-friendly and visually engaging representation of the OC Block-Chain is essential to facilitating participation and understanding of the platform. A Web2 visual representation will make the OC Block-Chain more accessible to a broader audience and encourage participation from users with varying levels of technical expertise. The following outlines the steps involved in creating the Web2 visual representation of the blockchain:

<details>

<summary>Stage 4.1 : Design Concept and Objectives</summary>

The project team will begin by defining the design concept and objectives for the Web2 visual representation. This will include considerations for usability, aesthetics, functionality, and overall user experience. The goal is to create a visually appealing and intuitive interface that clearly communicates the structure and relationships between main blocks, mini-blocks and nano-blocks within the OC Block-Chain.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Stage 4.2 : UI/UX Development</summary>

With the design concept and objectives defined, the team will work with UI/UX designers to develop the visual elements and user experience components of the Web2 interface. This will involve designing and prototyping interactive components, navigation structures, and visual representations of the blockchain data.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Stage 4.3 : Data Visualization and Mapping</summary>

To accurately represent the relationships between main blocks (collectibles) and the 10 million mini-blocks attached to each, the project team will develop a data visualization and mapping system. This system will visually display the complex blockchain structure, allowing users to quickly and easily understand the relationships between main blocks, mini-blocks, nano-blocks and OC tokens.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Stage 4.4 : Integration with the OC Project Platform</summary>

Once the Web2 visual representation has been developed and tested, it will be integrated into the OC Project platform. This will ensure that users can seamlessly interact with the blockchain data, mine OC tokens, and participate in the proof of time concept.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Stage 4.5 : User Testing and Feedback</summary>

To ensure that the Web2 visual representation effectively meets the needs of the platform's users, the project team will conduct user testing and solicit feedback from participants. This feedback will be used to refine the interface and address any usability or functionality issues that may arise during the testing phase.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Stage 4.6 : Ongoing Maintenance and Updates</summary>

As the OC Project platform evolves and expands, the Web2 visual representation will need to be updated and maintained to ensure it remains accurate and engaging. The project team will work closely with UI/UX designers and developers to implement necessary changes and improvements based on user feedback, platform updates, and emerging design trends.

{% hint style="info" %}
By creating a visually engaging and intuitive Web2 representation of the OC Project blockchain, the platform can effectively communicate the value and structure of the project to a wide range of users. This will encourage participation in the OC token mining process and facilitate a deeper understanding of the platform's core concepts, including proof of time and the unique relationships between collectibles, main blocks, and mini-blocks.
