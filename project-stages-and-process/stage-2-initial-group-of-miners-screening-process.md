<summary>Stage 2.1 : Invitation to Participate</summary>

The OC Project will begin by broadcasting an invitation to prospective miners, targeting an initial group of 100 participants. These miners will represent a diverse cross-section of people, bringing their unique perspectives and insights to the ranking process.

<summary>Stage 2.2 : Training and Orientation</summary>

Once the initial group of miners has been selected, they will undergo training and orientation to familiarize themselves with the OC Project and the goals of the ranking process. They will be educated on the Proof of Time concept, the project's focus on fairness and equality, and the importance of the collectibles in determining the value of the OC tokens.

<summary>Stage 2.3 : Presentation of Collectibles</summary>

The 2,100 collectibles integrated into the OC Project platform will be presented to the initial group of miners, who will review and assess each collectible based on its estimated value, provenance, historical significance, cultural importance, and overall quality.

<summary>Stage 2.4 : Categorization and Rating</summary>

The initial group of miners will work together to categorize the collectibles and assign ratings to each one. These ratings will consider factors such as the collectible's estimated value in USD, the number of followers or fans it has, and the quality of the asset. The ratings assigned by the miners will be collected and aggregated to create a comprehensive ranking system.

<summary>Stage 2.5 : Weighted Scoring and Allocation</summary>

The ratings assigned by the initial group of miners will be used to calculate a weighted score for each collectible, determining their overall ranking within the platform. Based on this ranking, OC tokens will be allocated to the respective main blocks, with higher-ranked collectibles receiving a larger share of tokens.

<summary>Stage 2.6 : Periodic Release of Main Blocks</summary>

Following the ranking and allocation process, main blocks representing the collectibles will be chained and released periodically. Upon completion of the mining process of a Main-Block, a new main block will be selected based on the previously determined rankings. The selection process will alternate between higher and lower-ranked collectibles, ensuring a dynamic and engaging mining experience until all 2,100 collectibles have been chosen for mining.

<details>

<summary>Stage 2.7 : Ongoing Engagement with Miners</summary>

The initial group of miners will continue to play a crucial role in the OC Project ecosystem, providing feedback, insights, and experiences sharing as the platform evolves. Their involvement will contribute to the project's ongoing success and its ability to uphold its core values of fairness and equality.
