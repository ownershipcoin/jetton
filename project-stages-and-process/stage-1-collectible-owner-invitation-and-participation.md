<summary>1.2 : Targeting Benefactors and Collectible Owners</summary>

The project will specifically target benevolent benefactors and owners of world-class collectibles, inviting them to donate their precious assets to form the fundamental building blocks of the platform.

<summary>1.4 : Submission and Verification Process</summary>

Interested collectible owners will be asked to submit detailed information about their collectibles, including provenance, appraisals, and any other relevant documentation that can attest to the authenticity and value of the assets.

<summary>1.5 : Integration of Collectibles into the Platform</summary>

Once a collectible has been accepted for participation in the project, it will be assigned a unique identifier and integrated into the platform as a main block. The main block will be linked to 10 million mini-blocks, which will serve as the mining units to generate circulating supply of OC tokens. The collectible owner will also be vested with 50% of the OC tokens allocated to the main block over a period of 24 months from the date their Main Block is chained to the OC Block-Chain.

<summary>1.6 : Ranking and Token Allocation</summary>

The 2,100 collectibles integrated into the platform will be ranked according to a weighted scoring system. This ranking will determine the allocation of OC tokens to each main block, with higher-ranked collectibles receiving a larger share of tokens.
