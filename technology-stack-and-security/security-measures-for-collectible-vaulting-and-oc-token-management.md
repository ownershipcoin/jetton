<details>

<summary>Secure Transit Vault (STV):</summary>

After the ranking and allocation process, the collectibles are stored in a Secure Transit Vault (STV). The STV is a state-of-the-art facility designed to safeguard high-value items, with stringent security measures such as 24/7 monitoring, access control systems, biometric authentication, and multi-layered physical security.

<details>

<summary>Multi-Signature Wallets</summary>

For the secure management of OC tokens, the project utilizes multi-signature wallets. These wallets require multiple signatures from authorized parties to approve transactions, adding an additional layer of security to prevent unauthorized access or malicious actions.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Secure Smart Contracts</summary>

The OC Project employs secure and audited smart contracts to manage the allocation, mining, and distribution of OC tokens. These smart contracts are developed following best practices in smart contract programming and are thoroughly tested and audited by external experts i.e. Certik to ensure their security and reliability.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Encrypted Communication</summary>

All communication between the miners, token holders, and the OC Project platform is encrypted using advanced cryptographic techniques. This ensures that sensitive information, such as private keys or user data, remains confidential and secure during transmission.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Periodic Security Audits</summary>

To maintain the highest levels of security, the OC Project will conduct periodic security audits of its platform, smart contracts, and infrastructure. These audits will be performed by external cybersecurity experts to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.

</details>

<details>

<summary>User Education and Best Practices</summary>

The OC Project will promote security awareness among its users by providing resources, guidelines, and best practices for securely managing their OC tokens and participating in the ecosystem. This will help ensure that users are well-equipped to protect their assets and contribute to the overall security of the platform.
